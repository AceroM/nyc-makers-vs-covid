			<div class="col-9"><p>
				We don't recommend 3D-printing masks and respirators. This <a href="">blog post by Prusa</a> explains it well:
				<br>
				<blockquote class="blockquote">
				<p>
					We here at Prusa Research are also looking for ways to help. We have been doing a lot of research and I want to address some of my concerns about printed respirators first before we move to the main story. I don’t intend to hamper the vibe we have now – not by a long shot, but <b>printing respirators might not be the best idea at this time</b>. Let me explain.
					<br><br>
					<b>None</b> of the designs available right now have been tested to ensure they provide the protections needed, at least none of the ones I am aware of. To help with this, we have collected as many designs as we could find, and are working with experts to see if we can verify which ones really work. What are the key focus points? First, it’s the sealing, then the filter itself, the filter to the mask, and how the mask attaches to the face – it all must be perfect. Most of us print rigid materials that are hard to make compliant for seals. Even if we can get a good seal, will it remain functional e.g. even when the wearer talks?
					<br><br>
					Another question we need to take into account is the <b>porosity of the printed parts</b> and the safety concerns that come from that. The wearer will have the mask on their face, a humid and warm place, a perfect breeding ground for germs. We won’t be able to sterilize these masks effectively so we might be causing even more problems. And the virus reportedly survives for over 48 hours on the plastics (or even 90 hours, according to some other studies). We all want to help our friends and families which means we should be all the more precautious to keep from hurting them. If you absolutely insist on printing a mask now, treat it like it is a basic surgical mask and not as a true respirator with all the protections they provide. <b>A false sense of security can be very dangerous</b>. I understand you’re trying to help, but PLEASE spread this info into your 3D printing groups.

				However, surgical masks can be sewn, according to <a href="https://www.unitypoint.org/cedarrapids/sewing-surgical-masks.aspx">UnityPoint Health hospital in Cedar Rapids</a>:
				<br><br>
				<blockquote class="blockquote">
				<p>
					UnityPoint Health – Cedar Rapids has an adequate supply of masks however – they remain in short supply nationwide due to COVID-19. The hospital is looking to be proactive in addressing the possibility of future supply challenges. Therefore, St. Luke's is calling all sewers to help make masks. Our hope is that we won't need them, but we must plan for the unknown. <br>
					<br>
					Fabric masks offer the benefit of being able to be washed and re-used as each healthcare worker will need to change their mask several times during their shifts, as the mask becomes soiled or damp – for maximum protection.
