# Open-Fold Face-Shield (OFFS) Project

## Fold-a-Shield designs for rapid assembly, flat-cut Face-Shields

[[alert]]
| This page has not been published yet, and does not contain finalized information.

These designs can be used to make complete PPE "Face-shields"† using only thin plastic materials and some folding. NO NEED FOR ANY OTHER MATERIALS OR ASSEMBLY. We have developed a range of designs that we believe will work for different materials and cutting methods, depending on what you have available. FEEDBACK welcome. Easy to change features. Cut them and try!

### **Current variants range A~I.**

Please leave feedback and contact info [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSehnuqDRV92HEEATVYcyxN5KKifcVe6o2ovSH7g0rzPuOLKtw/viewform?usp=sf_link) and we will keep you updated.

## Categories

For each design listed below, the following files are provided:

- Adobe Illustrator file of the design
- Adobe Illustrator file of the suggested tessellation
- DXF file for laser cutting or routing
- Video tutorial if available

Each design falls into two general categories:

| ![](img/offs/strap_drawing.jpg) | ![](img/offs/roll_drawing.jpg) |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| "Strap" approach (A-E, H)       | "Roll" approach (D-G)          |

They also share some common features:

| ![](img/offs/split_strap.png)                                                                    | ![](img/offs/closure.jpg)                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strap Split                                                                                      | Strap Closures                                                                                                                  |
| The split in the strap can be bent up to provide an ear-to-ear support over the top of the head. | Strap closures can be interchanged or modified as tab in slit, ratchet (left) or belt-type closures depending on material used. |
