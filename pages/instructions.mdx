# General Information

- UCLA has compiled information regarding DIY PPE designs here: [\[external link\]](https://docs.library.ucla.edu/display/LSD/COVID-19+Response%3A+3D+Printing+PPE+Equipment)
- TOM Global has a maker community here: [\[external link\]](https://tomglobal.org/community?id=5e73198894711e10b13ebe3b)

# Masks and Respirators

We don't recommend 3D-printing masks and respirators. This [blog post by Prusa](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/from-design-to-mass-3d-printing-of-medical-shields-in-three-days/) explains it well.

However, sewn masks can be worn individually or over N95 masks for added protection. We list available designs below.

### Olson Mask

Surgical masks can be sewn, according to [UnityPoint Health hospital in Cedar Rapids](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:tbxilmN4LPcJ:https://www.unitypoint.org/cedarrapids/sewing-surgical-masks.aspx+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us). The Olson Mask pattern is available here: [\[Internal Link\]](/pdf/OlsonMask_wPattern_v3.pdf)

> UnityPoint Health – Cedar Rapids has an adequate supply of masks however – they remain in short supply nationwide due to COVID-19. The hospital is looking to be proactive in addressing the possibility of future supply challenges. Therefore, St. Luke's is calling all sewers to help make masks. Our hope is that we won't need them, but we must plan for the unknown.
>
> Fabric masks offer the benefit of being able to be washed and re-used as each healthcare worker will need to change their mask several times during their shifts, as the mask becomes soiled or damp – for maximum protection.

### Turban Project Mask

This is another available sewn mask pattern, available via Deaconess Hospital. Instructions and patterns are available here: [\[external link\]](https://www.deaconess.com/How-to-make-a-Face-Mask)

### A.B. Mask

This design was vetted by the Skilled Laborers Brigade and is being manufactured in NYC. Instructions are available here: [\[External Link\]](https://www.instructables.com/id/AB-Mask-for-a-Nurse-by-a-Nurse/)

### DIY Pleated Masks

Instructions are available here: [\[External Link\]](https://www.project-cloth-masks.com/)

### DIY Paper Mask

This mask can be assembled in about 10 minutes using a piece paper. Ideal for the general public to avoid using supply that might be neede by hospitals or those who can't otherwise get access to other masks. Instructions are available here: [\[Internal Link\]](/pdf/Face_Mask_DIY_V2.4_JP_Leconte_PaperPaul.pdf)

# Face Shields

Face shields are worn by doctors and nurses when intubating patients to prevent fluids from contacting their face. They are often worn on top of N95 masks, and protects both the user and the mask. Face shields can be manufactured easily with 3D printing, laser cutting plastic sheets, or potentially die-cutting plastic sheets.

### Logistics + Legal

When manufacturing PPE, follow these instructions recommended by Prusa Research:

- **Act as if you were infected by the COVID-19 virus.** Wear a **face mask** and a **fresh pair of gloves** when collecting each batch of printed parts. Store the parts immediately in a sealable bag.
- Talk with whoever you’re making the shields for, let them know about your manufacturing environment.
- There is still debate about how long the virus survives on plastic, but most sources mention 2-3 days. That means that by letting the packed face shields sit for 2-3 days before distributing them, you’ll greatly reduce risk of transmission.
- **Do not store the entire stock in one place**, minimize the risk of cross-contamination.

One of our members have written a legal disclaimer (with lawyer consultation) to include with face shield donations to hospitals. It is available here: [\[internal link\]](/pdf/Face_Shield_Disclaimer.pdf). If you are selling such face shields, you may want to acquire your own legal counsel.

### 3DVerkstan Face Shield

![](/img/verkstan.jpg)  
**This is currently our preferred 3DP design.** It uses a glasses-like design, and does not require foam or elastic parts. It is designed for plastic from a sheet protector, with holes punched with a standard hole puncher.

Models can be downloaded from here: [\[external link\]](https://3dverkstan.se/protective-visor/protective-visor-versions/)

### WISC

![](/img/wisc.jpg)  
This is a face shield manufactured from a plastic sheet, foam tape, and elastic. This design takes far less time to manufacture, but is disposable due to the unsanitizable foam.

### Open Source Face Shield

![](/img/nyu.png)  
This is a face shield design by the NYU COVID-19 Task Force. It is manufactured from a plastic sheet and elastic. A well-placed plastic forehead piece prevents the need for a foam spacer.

The design is available here: [\[external link\]](https://open-face-ppe.now.sh/)

### Prusa RC2

![](/img/prusa.jpg)  
Designed by [Prusa Research](https://www.prusa3d.com/), this design involves 3D printed parts, a laser cut face shield, and an elastic backing.

- Blog post: [\[external link\]](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/from-design-to-mass-3d-printing-of-medical-shields-in-three-days/)
- Design: [\[external link\]](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/25857-prusa-protective-face-shield-rc2)

Companies are also printing and selling this design.

- Shapeways is selling just the 3DP parts for \$40 [\[external link\]](https://business.shapeways.com/covid19)
- Voodoo Manufacturing will be selling the completed shield for \$10 at bulk [\[external link\]](https://combatingcovid.com/)

While this may be the most durable design, the output may be too slow to meet the demand in NYC. It takes about 2~3 hours to print each headband part, which is too slow.

### Budmen

![](/img/budmen.jpeg)  
This is also a 3D printed design by Budmen Industries. Requesting or manufacturing the design requires registration. [\[external link\]](https://budmen.com/)
